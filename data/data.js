Ubbalux can also point them towards Bel’s Forge (Hex H2). (If it seems reasonable, Ubbalux might still be under the impression that Bel is the Archduke of Hell.)</li> <li>You can also solve Bel’s original “riddle” (see below).</li> </ul> <p><strong>INVESTIGATING THE STONES</strong>: Bel told Ubbalux that the secret to escaping the prison was hidden in the arcane runes etched across the standing stones. The trick is that crucial information is located on the outside of the stones, where Ubbalux can’t see it.</p> <ul> <li>A DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check indicates that each of the outer standing stones is associated with one of the schools of magic.</li> <li>A character who speaks Infernal or succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check will notice that each standing stone has a cartouche containing two syllables, one of which is either the first or second syllable of the associated school of magic in Infernal and the other appears to be a nonsense syllable.</li> <li>A similar cartouche appear on the inside of the stone (where Ubbalux can see it, although you can also look across the circle and see them from outside) with a similar pairing of the first or second syllable of the associated school of magic in Infernal (whichever one isn’t on the outside) and a nonsense syllable. </li> </ul> <p><strong>SOLVING THE RIDDLE</strong>: Combining the two “nonsense” syllables on each stone forms a command word associated with that stone. You can intuit the correct order of the syllables by looking at the matched syllable from the school of magic.

This fluted tower stands in the middle of a truly mammoth cavern, surrounded by temporary merchant camps and stockyard-type infrastructure.
