    <p>The market is now where High Rider Ikaia holds court. He’s able to bring supplies up through the Market’s access to the Maze and distribute them. There’s a soup kitchen running more or less 24/7, and the market stalls are slowly being converted into a tent city for those who have nowhere else to go. Ikaia is also beginning to organize armed patrols (most accompanied by a vampiric Son or Daughter) to distribute supplies to those who can’t reach the Market.</p>`,
